## Searching
So, uh, I guess `pip search` doesn't work? Seems kind of mickeymouse but whatever. Work arounds:
* Search on [PiPy](https://pypi.org/)
* DuckDuckGo has a `!pip` command

## Vue
* [python_vuejs](https://pypi.org/project/python_vuejs/)

## Machine Learning
Hey, at least I'll have acces to the best ML libs in the world!

* [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/index.html)
* [NLTK Text Classification](https://lost-contact.mit.edu/afs/cs.pitt.edu/projects/nltk/docs/tutorial/classifying/nochunks.html#:~:text=The%20nltk.classifier%20module%20defines%20ClassifierTrainerI%2C%20a%20general%20interface,new%20Naive%20Bayes%20classifier%20from%20a%20training%20corpus%3A)
* [PyClustering](https://pypi.org/project/pyclustering/#:~:text=%20pyclustering%20is%20a%20Python%2C%20C%2B%2B%20data%20mining,supported%20for%20Linux%2C%20Windows%20and%20MacOS%20operating%20systems.)
