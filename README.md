# (re)Learning Python
I'm relearning Python. It's been a while, but its exciting. Jumping in the deep and end and trying to get started with pip and pipenv, flask, and nltk for a little fun, and probably other modules as I learn about them. I'm taking notes as I go in Markdown files under `docs`

# Example Project
I'm going to develop a simple web based music player. It is an impractical project, but it will deal with tons of fundementals: file access, database, HTTP, JSON, etc. It'll be quick and dirty, and useless, but it'll do.
